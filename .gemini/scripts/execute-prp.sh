#
# Description:
#   Acts as an AI agent that uses `gemini-cli` to get a plan, then
#   uses `awk` to parse and execute the plan step-by-step.
# ---

# 1. Validate Input & Environment
# --------------------------------
if ! command -v gemini &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Error: gemini-cli is not installed or not in your PATH."
    echo "Please install it via npm: npm install -g @google/generative-ai-cli"
    exit 1
fi
if ! command -v awk &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Error: awk is required. Please ensure it is installed."
    exit 1
fi
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "Error: No PRP file specified."
  exit 1
fi

PRP_FILE_PATH=$1
if [ ! -f "$PRP_FILE_PATH" ]; then
  echo "Error: PRP file '$PRP_FILE_PATH' not found."
  exit 1
fi

# 2. Define the Execution Prompt
# ------------------------------
EXECUTE_PRP_PROMPT=$(cat <<'END_PROMPT'
You are an expert-level AI software engineer. Your task is to implement the feature described in the provided Product Requirements Prompt (PRP).

You MUST respond with a sequence of executable actions. Do NOT add any conversational text, explanations, numbering, or any text that is not part of an action block. Your entire response must be a sequence of these blocks.

There are only two types of blocks you can use:

1. A shell command to be executed. The block MUST start with ```bash on its own line and end with ``` on its own line.
   ```bash
   cargo new my-project
   ```

2. A file to be created or modified. The block MUST start with a line containing ONLY `CREATE path/to/file.ext` or `MODIFY path/to/file.ext`, followed by the language fence (e.g., ```rust) on the next line, the code, and a final ``` on its own line.
   CREATE src/main.rs
   ```rust
   fn main() {}
   ```

Generate the complete sequence of these blocks to implement the feature.
